Send an email to me(bas@hensenlab.org), with _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line!**

**We have an opening for a master thesis project for Leiden University students: Making levitated microparticles quantum with the first coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators fabricated in Leiden [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/other/Fabricating_CPW_resonators_in_Leiden_MSc_project.pdf)**


### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

We are always looking for excellent and motivated PhD students and postdocs to join us!

You will have the chance to work the edge of our knowledge on macroscopic quantum systems, using cutting edge nanofabrication techniques, ultra-low temperature measurements, 

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:bas@hensenlab.org). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line.
